I am a huge fan of your Hobby tier already! 

Having a free or entry level tier is a huge benefit for hobbyists and those looking to scale without racking up thousands in line items before finding proudct-market fit. As someone who loves to experiment with new tools and technologies, it is always disappointing to find tools locked behind large monthly or annual contracts. 

I'm glad that I was able to quickly try Mintlify. The free tier may drive me to replace my current Scalar docs set up for a side project.
