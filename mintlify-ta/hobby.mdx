I am a huge fan of your Hobby tier already!

A free or entry-level tier benefits hobbyists and those looking to scale without racking up thousands of line items before finding a product-market fit. As someone who loves experimenting with new tools and technologies, I find it disappointing to find tools locked behind large monthly or annual contracts.

With the potential of upgrading to a paid tier, Iâ€™m glad that I was able to quickly try Mintlify. The free tier may drive me to replace my current Scalar docs set up for a side project.
