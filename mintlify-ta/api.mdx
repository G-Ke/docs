## OpenAPI
OpenAPI support was something I expected, but the modular approach to documentation that Mintlify enables was what stood out to me. Starting with simple auto-generated docs and growing into more complex documentation with customized .mdx files for each endpoint feels incredibly powerful. My experience with similar tools has never allowed me to add detailed and beautifully formatted information to otherwise auto-generated OpenAPI docs (or you end up writing hundreds of lines of helper code to achieve minor customization of the docs).


## Playground
The playground is an essential feature for me, as I often like to have my dev site running and use it for performing tests from time to time as I develop. It also makes getting familiarized with a new API 10x easier for customers. In my support experience working heavily with external partner APIs, having a playground available to test and troubleshoot is much more efficient than creating a Postman project or using one-off cURL commands when working in unfamiliar territory. A robust, attractive, and well-architected documentation site is not guaranteed but makes all the difference to those consuming that information and the work needed to support them.

## Scraper
I loved the scraper to generate the .mdx files, and I look forward to trying Mintlify with an actual API (not a mock API) to utilize the Playground.
