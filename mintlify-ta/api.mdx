Being able to work from an existing OpenAPI spec is clearly a non-negotiable for the product, but I was very excited to see the modular approach that Mintlify makes available to developers. Being able to start with simple auto-generated docs and grow into more complex documentation with customized .mdx files for each endpoint is incredibly powerful. My experience with similar tools has never allowed me to add detailed and beautifully formatted information to otherwise auto-generated OpenAPI docs (or you end up writing hundreds of lines of helper code to achieve minor customization of the docs).

The playground is an essential feature for me, as I often like to have my dev site running and use it for performing tests from time to time as I develop. It also makes getting familarized with a new API 10x easier for customers.

In general I loved the scraper to generate the .mdx files, and I look forward to trying Mintlify with an actual API (not a mock API) to utilize the Playground.
