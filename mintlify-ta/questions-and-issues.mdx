# Snippets Not Displayed Using Mintlify dev

**Problem:** I struggled to get snippets to show up after creating them according to the documentation [reusable-snippets in quickstart](https://mintlify.com/docs/reusable-snippets). They would not populate in the localhost dev preview. 

**Solution:** This was resolved by restarting the dev preview at the command line. The snippet was then loaded successfully.

I was a bit confused for a few minutes, initially thinking I must have made a mistake creating the snippet or inserting it in another page.
