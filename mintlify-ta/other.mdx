## Amazing workflow

The user/developer experience feels much smoother and more natural than working with something like Gitbook or a rigid built-in docs-generator. Everything is approachable and familiar:

- `.mdx` + JSX HTML-like components
- Prism
- Git + GitHub
- OpenAPI
- etc.

## REST API

It's fantastic to see Mintlify giving teams several different options to ensure they can keep their sites updated. No matter how they have chosen to handle their configuration.

## AI

I came across a Twitter thread of a recent AI Devtools hackathon the Mintlify team had and was very impressed. I love that there is so much support for folks to go and build new tools at the cutting edge. I've really enjoyed working with these new tools, which is why I have been working with Cursor instead of VSCode + GitHub Copilot. It would be awesome to work somewhere like Mintlify where this hacking spirit is alive, well, and encouraged.

### AI Chat

The AI chat support was excellent in my limited tests. I realize this is a product by Inkeep, but it is still a fantastic way to apply LLMs and knowledge management at the source. Solutions like this are great use cases for LLMs and will benefit a client's customers and their internal teams. I'd love to learn more about Mintlify's plans to grow/expand/improve on this aspect of the product.

### AI Widget

Building on what I said above, I love having a single source of truth for everyone, internal and external, and leveraging that truth through several tools deployed across the company. I would be most excited to help support features like this. 

Now I also have another set of beautiful Mintlify docs to read through.. [Inkeep Docs](https://docs.inkeep.com/overview/getting-started)
