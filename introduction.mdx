## What

This site details my thoughts after using Mintlify for the first time. It's not massively detailed, but it goes into a bit about what I configured, some thoughts I had while getting familiarized, and even some of the speedbumps I encountered. 

## Why

I came across Mintlify after seeing a job posting for a **Founding Support Engineer**. After reviewing the posting and loving what I read, I went to your website and had to dig right in. It felt natural to get my hands dirty with the product and use it to learn more about the company and the position. What could be a better way to learn about a company or understand the problems its users may encounter and need support to resolve?
